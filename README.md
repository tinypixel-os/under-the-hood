## Mini Language Implementation
This project is an exploration of the internals of a programming language, covering:

- Tokenizer (Lexical Analysis) – Breaking source code into meaningful tokens.
- Parser – Converting tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Interpretor – Executing code directly from the AST.
- Compiler – Translating code into another form, like bytecode or machine code.

### Gettings started

Running the tokenizer
```
git clone https://github.com/tinypixel-os/under-the-hood.git
cd under-the-hood

npm install -g typescript
tsx lexer.ts
node lexer.js
```
