## Mini Language Implementation
This project is an exploration of the internals of a programming language, covering:

- Tokenizer (Lexical Analysis) – Breaking source code into meaningful tokens.
- Parser – Converting tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
- Interpretor – Executing code directly from the AST.
- Compiler – Translating code into another form, like bytecode or machine code.
